Welcome to Tanks? by Ben Wedin, Raven Pillman, Aidan Holloway-Bidwell, and
Nate Osher. The object of the game is to hit your opponent with projectiles and
reduce their health to zero before they do so to you. Each tank starts with
100 fuel which they can use to move during their turns throughout the game. Each
tank can also adjust the angle of its nozzle and the force of its shot using
either the sliders or the arrow keys. The up arrow and down arrow keys increase
and decrease the angle of the nozzle, the right and left arrow keys move the
tank right and left, and the f key fires the projectile.

We chose not to test getter/setter methods, void methods, and methods that
involve random generation.

Enjoy!
